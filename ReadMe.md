# Three rewritten articles from the YAPI Help Center

To demonstrate my revisions, I copied the source code from the three yapi help pages, made revisions, and then deployed each to github pages.  I felt this would be the best format to showcase revisions of online articles.  Below you will find a hyperlink to the original article, followed by a hyperlink to my revision, and then a brief summary of the changes I made.  Thanks for considering me for this position!

## First Article

* The original article can be found [here](https://help.yapicentral.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000115407-Displaying-Images-in-GMail){:target="_blank"} - Displaying Images in Gmail 

* Deployed revision is [here](https://crowned1.github.io/gmailArticle/)

### Summary of changes:
I corrected several instances of miscapitalized "GMail" to "Gmail"(title and sidebar), and updated some article styling (social media links at bottom are now centered, I added my picture and name to article header). I found some of the wording of the initial paragraph to be too technical for a regular user, so I removed the technical jargon. I also got rid of the bold font. I then added some pictures to the article to help the user find the appropriate section, and added a closing parargraph to send the user off.
